### Hi there 👋

* 👨‍🔬 I'm a data science enthusiast
* ⏰ Here, you will find some of my old data science projects, mostly built during my data science learning phase
* 🎄Majority of the newer repos are private, that I intend to open them in due course of time
* 📖 I use both R and Python
* 🛠 I am currently working on porting my blog [datalearnings.com](https://www.datalearnings.com/post/) from R to Python
* 📞 I am happy to collaborate on advanced data analytics projects. Feel free to reach out on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitagni/)
